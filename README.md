## Problem Statement
Define which problem you solved with your project.
Automatic Number plate Recognition and Detection .
The main focus in this project is to experiment deeply with, and find
alternative solutions to the image segmentation and character recognition problems
within the License Plate Recognition framework. Three main stages are identified in
such applications. 
First, it is necessary to locate and extract the license plate region from a larger
scene image. Second, having a license plate region to work with, the alphanumeric
characters in the plate need to be extracted from the background. Third, deliver
them to an OCR system for recognition.

## Learning Process
Decribe which tools you used within the learning phase and how you achieved to build your project. Additionally, formulate what you have learning during this project.
I used python , jupyter notebook , OpenCV  and tensorflow 
I learned how to detect license plate from images and in real time from video and how to apply OCR to license  plate to extreact the plate number also I learned how to save license plates detected for future analysis and searching
